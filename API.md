## Data formats
### Definition item
Depending on whether the user has a second dictionary source enabled, it can be either:
```json
{
    "word": "blue",
    "definition": "a color..."
}
```
or
```json
{
    "word": "blue",
    "definition": "a color...",
    "definition2": "az√∫l"
}
```
### Note item
```json
{
    "sentence": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "word": "fox",
    "definition": "an animal..",
    "tags": []
}
```
Please note that even with "tags" being an empty array, the default tags specified in ssmtool config will still be added.

Using two definitions is not yet supported.
