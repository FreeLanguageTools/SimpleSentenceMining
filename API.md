## Data formats
### Definition item
Depending on whether the user has a second dictionary source enabled, it can be either:
```json
{
    "word": "blue",
    "definition": "a color..."
}
```
or
```json
{
    "word": "blue",
    "definition": "a color...",
    "definition2": "az√∫l"
}
```
### Note item
```json
{
    "sentence": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "word": "fox",
    "definition": "an animal..",
    "tags": []
}
```
Please note that even with `tags` being an empty array, the default tags specified in ssmtool config will still be added.

Using two definitions is not yet supported, and neither are audio and image data, but they are expected to be added in the future as optional fields in base64 format or as file paths. 

### Translation item
```json
{
    "src": "ru",
    "dst": "en",
    "translation": "This is a book"
}
```
The `src` and `dst` fields are always present regardless of whether they are specified in URL query parameters. When not specified they represent user settings.
